Inform7 source code for GeoQuest. GeoQuest is a text based Geocaching.com puzzle at http://coord.info/GC1XBVY

SPOILER ALERT:  By reading these files, you will be able to see the solution to the puzzles. GeoCaching is a game and it's up to you how much of a challenge you'd like to make it. It's a lot more fun to try to figure it out yourself first however.

Inform7
-------
I used Inform7 to build GeoQuest.  Inform is a design system for interactive fiction based on natural language. It is a radical reinvention of the way interactive fiction is designed, guided by contemporary work in semantics and by the practical experience of some of the world's best-known writers of IF.

Parchment
---------
In the parchment directory, you'll find the HTML source code in order to run GeoQuest via a web browser.
